## How many apps can I build?

In a Lite account, your apps have up to 256 MB of instantaneous runtime memory. You can deploy apps until you use the available Lite account allowance.

There's no limits to the number of apps you can build in a billable account.

When you reach any quota limit for Lite plan instances, the service for that month is suspended. Quota limits are per org, not per instance. New instances that are created in the same org show any usage from previous instances. The quota limits reset on the first of every month.
